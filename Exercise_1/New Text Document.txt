Hi 
Can you please provide more details about following queries from the task T1.2
a) extracting data by attribute filtering
data_extracted1 = ...
print(data_extracted1.head(1))
Question : Which attribute we need to filter on. Can we choose any column or row attribute, i.e. column attribute like OBSERVATION_COUNT>2, create a data set of all rows having this attribute, save it in data_extracted1.
b) # reset the index of data_extracted1 after filtering
data_reindexed = ...
print(data_reindexed.head(1))
Question : Does this task mean that  in data_extracted1, which contains various rows belonging to first attribute, we reset the row numbers from 0---n.
c) delete columns completely by using df.drop()
data_deleting = ...
print(data_deleting.head(1))
Question : Can we delete
